# IQOD_Misc_24

## DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY

```
array = [[4, 5, 6, 1, 8], [2, 3, 4, 5], [7, 5, 3]]
```
Using the array above as an example, create a program that will add the first, middle, and last numbers of each array in the child array. When there is an even number of numbers use the low middle number to include in the sum. Print the set of each child array in the console.

Example:

```
array = [[2, 3, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]]
iqod(array)
```
Output:

```
10
8
```
